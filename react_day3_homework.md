#Lab/homework

Create a React app using React Router. 

Select an API with different routes, for example the SWAPI (Star Wars API) [Star Wars API](https://swapi.co/).

Use different pages to display different catagories of data, for example Planets, People, Ships on seperate pages.

If you want to use a different API you're welcome to, as long as it has multiple pages.

Bonus points for ES6 usage!!
